My colleague [Joshua Lane](http://www.joshualane.com/) just switched to using a Mac, so I thought now might be a good time to talk about the tools I use for development.  Josh has actually seen most of these, but maybe there are one or two you (or he) haven't.

## The core
I spend most of my day staring at:

* [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/)
* [GNU Screen](http://www.gnu.org/s/screen/) - Tabs are for suckers
* [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) - My editor of choice. YMMV
* [Quicksilver](http://qsapp.com/) - Spiff launcher tool.  Comparable to LaunchBar, et al.  Has become an extension of my fingers
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/) - 'Nuff said
* [RVM](https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/) - If you are doing Ruby development, do yourself a favor and install RVM

## Supporting cast
* [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) - [As with RVM above.]
* [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/) and [not Homebrew](http://mojinations.com/blog/2011/08/07/homebrew--no-thanks/) for installing various Unix ports (Git, MySQL, etc.)
* [Pow](http://pow.cx/) and the Powder gem - Beautifully simple web server for local development.  Powder makes Pow even easier to use
* [GitX](http://gitx.frim.nl/) - I actually run one of the forks, but damned if I can remember which
* Some TextMate extras:
  * [ProjectPlus](http://ciaranwal.sh/projectplus) - Much sexiness for the project drawer, including SCM integration.
  * [GetBundles](http://solutions.treypiepmeier.com/2009/02/25/installing-getbundles-on-a-fresh-copy-of-textmate/) - Just what it sounds like
  * [AckMate](https://github.com/protocool/ackmate) - Far superior to TM's built-in project search. 
  * [Baby, the code shines bright](http://www.pixelpopdev.com/baby-the-code-shines-bright/) - Purdie color theme.  I've been sticking this on all the pairing stations at work.  (Yes, that was me.)

## Honorable mentions 
* [Airfoil](http://www.rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/) - Route audio from any app to remote speakers or another Mac
* [Caffeine](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/) - Keeps my screen from dimming while I am otherwise occupied
* [Pastebot Sync](http://tapbots.com/software/pastebot/#sync) - Companion to the Pastebot iPhone app.  Allows copying text/images between Mac and iPhone
* [F.lux](http://stereopsis.com/flux/) - Easy on the eyes and I think I'm sleeping better
* [Lab Tick](http://labtick.proculo.de/) - Stops MacOS from second-guessing my keyboard backlight setting
* [Fluid](http://fluidapp.com/) - Site-specific browsers for the win
* [Divvy](http://mizage.com/divvy/) - Nice window management
* [Teleport](http://www.abyssoft.com/software/teleport/) - Easiest means I've seen of controlling adjacent Macs
* [Perian](http://perian.org/) - Lets QuickTime open all those crazy video formats
* [Hazel](http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php) - Helps manage waxy buildup of stray files
* [WebMonitor](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/web-monitor/id418832006?mt=12) - Pings my personal websites periodically and complains if one is down

## In case it wasn't obvious
* [Adium](http://adium.im/) - Multiprotocol IM client
* [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com/) - Don't leave home without it
* [Evernote](http://evernote.com/) - You know the drill
* [OmniFocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/) - Todo list on steroids
* [Colloquy](http://colloquy.info/) - IRC client
